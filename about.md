I am a software developer, improviser, runner, writer, and dreamer.

The purpose of this website is to share with the world essentially whatever I feel like sharing, whenever, even if updates are far between, and to provide basic profile information about me. So far, this site is filled with coding things, but blog posts aren't necessarily coding themed.

Most importantly, through my strengths I want to making this world a better place than before we came to it.
