*Note: Below is the only journal entry I have about City Night in a private file. I don't see why I didn't make a public blog post about this. Maybe it was too vulnerable for me to say at the time.*

Last time I visited this document was 4 years ago, and 4 years before that.
But I like the thought of keeping a journal. I'm renaming this document
from timeline to journal. That sounds a little more comforting than a
timeline. And I think I will be a little more proud updating this document.
I feel a little sick opening this document I started. Eight years, this
game has been circling around in my mind.

I have arthritis. It hurts a bit to type this, in addition to the pain of
being reminded by this document,so that's annoying. I'm getting older. 27.
If I don't start working on this daily, I won't have a game at all. This
year I decided it would make more sense to release the game in parts.
But maybe it should be even smaller than that. Episodes, maybe.

This game is very ambitious, so I think to release in episodes is the
wisest choice.
