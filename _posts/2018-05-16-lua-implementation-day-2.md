I feel rather productive today! I've done quite a bit since the last post and now we are able to execute game commands on the fly with the Lua console, such as jumping to any map on the fly.

Bonus: Map 0 is the first thing I ever  created for this game in December of 2014! I started drawing this map even before doing any programming. Sadly, the game has changes quite a bit and it uh, clashes with the new art style I've chosen. In fact, below is my first screenshot of the game. I was using Love2D at the time, which incidentally uses Lua. Since then, I've changed the game quite a bit and City Night is programmed in C now.

Hopefully, I can finish up what I want to do with Lua tomorrow and we can move on.
