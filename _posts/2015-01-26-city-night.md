I want you all to know that I’m still alive and I still work on the code at least like 30 minutes each day, but my calc class is difficult for me, so I probably won’t be able to make very much progress until it’s over (in 6 weeks). Also, February is going to be a very busy month at work, so I might be exhausted from that, too. Anyway, I probably won’t post much in February bercause of that.

Also, I’m going to take linear algebra after that, and I also heard that it’s difficult, so I think may or may not be busy until May 10, when that is over.

Sorry, guys.
