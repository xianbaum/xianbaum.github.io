I found that I was spending a lot of time on Tumblr, so I wrote a script that posts to tumblr for me. I basically just open a text editor, create whatever post I want and then execute my script. I’m hoping it works out okay. I really like Tumblr as a blogging platform, but I don’t want the social media side of it to take up all of my time. I also did sort of the same thing with Twitter, except a script that posts to Twitter already exists, and it does a lot more than just that. I guess it means I won’t actually “BE” on here so much anymore. I hope.

Anyway, I published the code on GitHub at <https://github.com/xianbaum/tumblrcli> if anyone is interested. The only thing it really can’t do is edit, reblog, or do photosets. You have to do that manually for now. I don’t know how submitting multiple images works.
