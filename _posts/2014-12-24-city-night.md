I should be sleeping, but here’s a sneak-peek at a game I’ve been working on for the past week-ish. I’m coding using Love2D. I plan to put it out to the public for free on New Years Eve or New Years Day, and there’s still so much to do! You can probably note some oddities with animation and he fact that they walk into walls and that nothing happens if dogs actually catch you yet. This stuff will hopefully be fixed soon. Anyway, I need to be awake in 3 hours so good night!

*Note November 24 2024: this game is City Night.*
