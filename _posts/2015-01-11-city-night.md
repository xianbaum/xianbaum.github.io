I’m having a lot of fun with the idea of multiple characters. :) Although I noticed that the enemies only target the current player. I’ll have to make it so they stay on their targeted player. It would be too easy if all you had to do was switch character to not get hit.

Btw, when they seem to disappear in the video, their sprite is actually flashing but OBS is recording it at 30 fps when it flashes at 60 fps so it doesn’t record the flashes.

Also, I don’t think I showed off screen transitions or dialog boxes yet, but they exist in the code. Changing maps is buggy with multiple characters right now, anyway.
