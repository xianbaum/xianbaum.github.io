Okay, now I should be 100% done with the menus. I wasn’t even planning to include an options menu before, but I figured it would be a quick to add.. it only took like… 5 hours. :P

Anyway, there’s much more exciting progress going on in the actual game right now that I’d like to show off in the next few days!

*Note November 24 2024: this game is City Night.*
