I’m not sure.

Left is old style. Right is new style. The right one could definitely use some work, but I’m not sure if I’m skilled enough to keep up with that style. If done well, the right style could be amazing, but it’s unacceptable in its current state. Also, I sort of liked the MOTHER feel of the left style.
