Hi, I’ve decided to use this blog as my general software development blog. So, not just for Punching Out Cthulhu (which is still in development, albeit slow development), I figure people who follow my personal blog probably don’t care (although I doubt many people really care about what goes on in my normal life, heh) and not even just limited to game development. Here is progress of another game I’ve been making. It’s not much right now, but please check it out.

I’ve named it Jump ‘N’ Shoot Man for now, and it’s a runner game with two buttons, “Jump” and “Shoot”. That’s obviously not what it’s going to be called (especially since the character is a woman). It was originally planned to be a much more terrible game and I was going to release it because I thought “Flappy Bird is popular, so why not this?” but it kind of grew on me.

In addition to this, I’m going to be participating in my first game jam, /agdg/’s MicroGame Jam. I’m very optimistic about this (and the future of my game/software development) so please check this blog out (I mean, if you want).

*Note November 24 2024: This game (which I call Jump 'N' Shoot Man here) was heavily edited and released as Kat's Dream. The source code is here: <https://github.com/xianbaum/katsdream>. The game I mentioned that I was going to make for the Game Jam turned into City Night.*
