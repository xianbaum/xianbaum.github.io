I posted this three times before realizing I screwed something up. Third time’s the charm I hope!

Sorry, I’m not doing a very good job of keeping you guys posted, or keeping this blog updated. I was originally planning to have this game done by New Years day, but some things came up. For instance, I got sick and wasted several days of potential progress to recovery. I’m gonna need a few more weeks I think. Anyway, the extended deadline I gave myself will mean more flexibility for this game and a better end-product, so I hope you guys look forward to this game!

Very little changed to the actual game, but I finally got some basic menus down. They’re pretty bare bones right now, but I’m probably going to add quite a bit of pizzazz or something. Or, maybe not, this bare-bones look sort of grew on me… Anyway, here’s a video of the menus and of saving/loading in action, which works flawlessly so far.

I titled it “American Evening” for now. I think this is going to be one of those things that sort of just starts out slow and then comes together really fast in the end, so stay tuned! And polish… I don’t know how long I’m going to spend polishing the game, but I think not very long because I’m already way later than I expected.

Oh, one final thing. You probably noticed “glitchy” lines that sometimes appear in between tiles in the video. Don’t worry! They’ll be gone next time I post a video.I should be sleeping, but here’s a sneak-peek at a game I’ve been working on for the past week-ish. I’m coding using Love2D. I plan to put it out to the public for free on New Years Eve or New Years Day, and there’s still so much to do! You can probably note some oddities with animation and he fact that they walk into walls and that nothing happens if dogs actually catch you yet. This stuff will hopefully be fixed soon. Anyway, I need to be awake in 3 hours so good night!

*Note November 24 2024: this game is City Night.*
